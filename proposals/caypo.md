# Development Fund Proposal

**Author:** Anıl Karaçay - anil@cayvox.com (Canton Catalyst 2026 #1 place)
**Status:** Submitted
**Created:** 2026-03-21

## Abstract

CAYPO brings the Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) to Canton Network, enabling AI agents to hold USDCx, make instant payments, and access 17+ API services through a single SDK. MPP is the open payment standard by Stripe and Tempo, already integrated with Visa, Lightning, Solana, and Sui. Canton is among the leading institutional blockchains yet to integrate with MPP — CAYPO aims to address this gap.

Milestones 1–2 are already completed and live. We are requesting **2,000,000 CC** across 4 milestones (M1–M2 retroactive, M3–M4 forward-looking).

**Live deliverables:** [caypo.xyz](https://caypo.xyz) · [mpp.caypo.xyz](https://mpp.caypo.xyz) · [npm @caypo](https://www.npmjs.com/org/caypo) · [GitHub](https://github.com/anilkaracay/Caypo) · [mpp-specs PR #198](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/198)

All five CAYPO packages are open-source under Apache 2.0 / MIT dual license. Any Canton developer can use @caypo/mpp-canton and @caypo/canton-sdk as building blocks to create their own agent payment applications, deploy custom gateways with their own service endpoints, or extend the MCP tool set for domain-specific use cases. CAYPO is not a closed product — it is open payment infrastructure that any team in the Canton ecosystem can build on.

## Specification

### 1. Objective

**Problem:** The agentic economy represents a $3–5 trillion opportunity that Canton is well-positioned to participate in with the right infrastructure in place

McKinsey projects agentic commerce will mediate **$3 trillion to $5 trillion** in global commerce by 2030. Morgan Stanley estimates **$190–$385 billion** in US e-commerce from agentic shoppers by 2030. The agentic payment infrastructure market is projected to grow from **$7 billion to $93 billion by 2032** — a 13× expansion.

A growing number of major ecosystems are already exploring or adopting MPP:

| Chain | MPP Integration | Status | Link |
|-------|----------------|--------|------|
| **Tempo** | Native (Stripe × Tempo) | ✅ Live | [mpp.dev/payment-methods/tempo](https://mpp.dev/payment-methods/tempo) |
| **Stripe** | Fiat rails (card, bank) | ✅ Live | [mpp.dev/payment-methods/stripe](https://mpp.dev/payment-methods/stripe) |
| **Visa** | Intelligent Commerce tokens | ✅ Live | [mpp.dev/payment-methods/card](https://mpp.dev/payment-methods/card) |
| **Lightning** | Bitcoin via Lightspark/Spark | ✅ Live | [mpp.dev/payment-methods/lightning](https://mpp.dev/payment-methods/lightning) |
| **Sui** | t2000 — full agent banking platform | ✅ Live | [t2000.ai](https://t2000.ai) |
| **Sui** | Community charge intent spec | PR open | [mpp-specs PR #195](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/195) |
| **Solana** | Solana Foundation official SDK | In dev | [github.com/solana-foundation/mpp-sdk](https://github.com/solana-foundation/mpp-sdk) |
| **Solana** | Community charge intent spec | PR open | [mpp-specs PR #188](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/188) |
| **Whop** | Platform payments | PR open | [mpp-specs PR #197](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/197) |
| **Stellar** | Stellar charge intent spec | PR open | [mpp-specs PR #199](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/199) |
| **Canton** | **CAYPO** — USDCx via CIP-56 | PR open | [mpp-specs PR #198](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/198) |

Canton is currently among the few institutional-focused blockchains exploring MPP integration, with Caypo leading this effort. Expanding Canton’s MPP support would help capture a share of emerging agent payment flows that are currently developing across multiple ecosystems

**Intended outcome:** Canton becomes a first-class MPP payment method — recognized alongside Tempo, Stripe, Visa, and Lightning — with a live gateway, comprehensive SDK, and production mainnet deployment. The entire stack ships as open-source building blocks: any Canton developer can compose these packages into their own agent payment products without depending on us.

### 2. Implementation Mechanics

CAYPO is a complete agent finance platform consisting of 5 npm packages:

- **@caypo/mpp-canton** — Canton payment method for MPP. Implements charge intent using CIP-56 TransferFactory.Transfer with USDCx. Zod schema validation, full error handling.
- **@caypo/canton-sdk** — Core SDK. Canton JSON Ledger API v2 client, USDCx operations (Holding queries, transfer, merge), encrypted wallet (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2), safeguards (per-tx and daily limits), traffic management, MPP auto-pay client. String-based decimal arithmetic — no floating point.
- **@caypo/canton-cli** — 36 commands. Agent wallet management, USDCx transfers, MPP auto-pay, MCP server installation, savings, credit, exchange, investment operations.
- **@caypo/canton-mcp** — MCP server. 35 tools + 20 prompts. Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible AI assistant.
- **@caypo/canton-gateway** — MPP API proxy (Hono framework). 17 services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, fal.ai, Firecrawl, Brave Search, and 10 others), 46 endpoints. Agents pay in USDCx via HTTP 402, gateway verifies payment on Canton, forwards to upstream API.

**Technology stack:** TypeScript, pnpm monorepo, Turborepo, Vitest, Zod, Hono, Node.js. Canton JSON Ledger API v2 (gRPC/HTTP). CIP-56 Token Standard (TransferFactory, TransferPreapproval).


### 3. Architectural Alignment

**CIP-0082 — "dev tools":** CAYPO provides the first Canton SDK designed for agent developers. 35 MCP tools, 36 CLI commands, comprehensive TypeScript API.

**CIP-0082 — "reference implementations":** CAYPO is the reference implementation for MPP on Canton. The Canton method spec ([mpp-specs PR #198](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/198)) establishes Canton as an officially recognized payment method.

**CIP-0082 — "critical infra":** The MPP gateway at [mpp.caypo.xyz](https://mpp.caypo.xyz) is live infrastructure that any Canton application can use to accept agent payments. The `/llms.txt` and `/api/services` endpoints enable automated agent discovery.

**CIP-0047 — Featured Apps:** CAYPO gateway generates on-chain activity markers (USDCx transfers, CC traffic burn) that contribute to Canton's reward distribution. Featured App application planned for Milestone 3.

**CIP-56 — Token Standard:** All USDCx operations use CIP-56 TransferFactory.Transfer with TransferPreapproval for 1-step automated payments.

**Upstream contribution:** Canton method specification submitted to [tempoxyz/mpp-specs](https://github.com/tempoxyz/mpp-specs/pull/198), positioning Canton alongside Tempo, Stripe, and Visa in the MPP ecosystem.

### 4. Backward Compatibility

No backward compatibility impact. CAYPO is a new application-layer product built on top of existing Canton infrastructure (JSON Ledger API v2, CIP-56 Token Standard, Global Synchronizer). It does not modify any protocol-level components.

## Motivation

Canton Network is backed by the world's largest financial institutions — DTCC, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, BNP Paribas — and is uniquely positioned to play a meaningful role in the fastest-growing segment of the digital economy: agentic payments. With CAYPO, we aim to unlock this opportunity for the Canton ecosystem.

McKinsey projects **$3–5 trillion** in global agentic commerce by 2030. The agentic payment infrastructure market alone is projected to reach **$93 billion by 2032**. Google, Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and Tempo have all launched dedicated agent payment infrastructure. Sui and Solana already have MPP integrations with live gateways and SDKs.

If Canton captures just **10% of the $93B agentic payment market**, that represents **$9.3B in transaction volume** flowing through the network — generating CC traffic fees, Featured App rewards, and ecosystem activity.

## Rationale

**Why MPP?** MPP is the open standard by Stripe and Tempo, backed by Visa, Paradigm, and Lightspark. It uses HTTP 402 — the same web infrastructure that powers the entire internet. 100+ services are already integrated. MPP is to agent payments what HTTPS is to web security — the emerging default.

**Why MPP over x402?** MPP is rail-agnostic — it works with any blockchain, fiat rail, or payment network. Canton's non-EVM architecture (DAML, gRPC Ledger API) makes EVM-native protocols like x402 less suitable, as they are primarily designed for EVM-based environments, whereas Canton’s architecture differs significantly. MPP's extensible method system (`Method.from()`) was designed exactly for chains like Canton that have unique settlement mechanics. Additionally, MPP's session intent enables streaming micropayments — critical for pay-per-token LLM billing — which x402 does not natively support.

**Why a full platform, not just a payment method?** A payment method alone is a library. A platform is an ecosystem. Agents don't just need to pay — they need to manage funds, enforce spending limits, discover services, and interact through natural language. CAYPO delivers the complete stack: encrypted wallets with AES-256-GCM, per-transaction and daily safeguards, 35 MCP tools for AI assistant integration, a live gateway with 17 services, and CLI tooling for DevOps. This helps position Canton not only as a network that supports payments, but as one where agents can actively operate.
**Why Cayvox Labs?** We are a Canton mainnet validator operator, Canton Catalyst 2026 #1 place. We have deep experience with DAML, Canton's Ledger API, CIP standards, and validator operations. M1+M2 are already delivered — proven execution, not promises.

**Why open-source building blocks?** A proprietary payment SDK creates a single point of dependency. Open-source infrastructure creates an ecosystem. By publishing every package under Apache 2.0 / MIT, CAYPO enables Canton developers to fork the gateway and serve only their own API endpoints, import @caypo/mpp-canton into their own DeFi protocol for agent-native USDCx settlement, extend the 35 MCP tools with domain-specific agent skills, and build competing or complementary products on top of the same Canton payment primitives. The Development Fund investment produces shared infrastructure, not a single vendor's product.
